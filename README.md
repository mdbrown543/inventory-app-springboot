# Inventory Application with Spring Boot Backend

An inventory management application that displays a list of items, each with characteristics such as title, description category, image, and price. This project is a continuation of another inventory application, and uses **React**, **Bootstrap**, **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **Maven** to store items in a MySQL database, register and login users under admin or standard user roles, validate input, perform CRUD operations, handle errors, and enable pagination and sorting on pages.
